# Unit-7-Lab-2
Lab Goal :   This lab was designed to teach you more about lists.  You will need to use a variable, a loop, and if statement.

Lab Description :   Write a program that will search through a list to see if the last value in the list occurs more than once.  If the last value occurs in the list more than once, return true.  Otherwise, return false.  If the list is empty, return false.  You will also write the Main method.  I suggest that you use Arrays.asList to create the ArrayLists.
